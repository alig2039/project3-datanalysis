<h1 align="center">Analyzing Kaggle Data Science Survey of 2021</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://dataanalysis2021.herokuapp.com/)

Kaggle is a professional community for data scientists and machine learning engineers. They conduct developer surveys every year, and the collected data is available open-source on the web. With proper analysis, the Dataset would help us to answer real-world questions. For instance, we can find the most popular language that the data scientists use. Our project is to analyze the survey data and gather meaningful insights from it.

The questions that we answered as part of the analysis were given in the Data analysis. This readme.md file explains our project.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are black, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

        
## Features

-   Runs in a commandline


## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

-   [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)


### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
    - .This is a Python library for data analysis and manipulation. It is what was used to read the CSV survey data and covert it into dataframes which could be easy to analyze.
2. [NUmpy](https://numpy.org/)
    - This is a tool for scientific coputing using Python. This helps us group our data into arrays, we also used it to access functions that were necessary for making decisions of attributes in our dataframes.
3. [Time](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - This module provides various time-related functions.
4. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
5. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
6. [Photoshop:](https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/photoshop.html)
    - Photoshop was used to create the logo, resizing images and editing photos for the website.


## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://github.com/)
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://github.com/)


### Known Bugs

- Since it is a CLI application, it can only run within a terminal environment.

3. Go to the 
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
