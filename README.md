<h1 align="center">Analyzing Kaggle Data Science Survey of 2021</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://dataanalysis2021.herokuapp.com/)

Kaggle is a professional community for data scientists and machine learning engineers. They conduct developer surveys every year, and the collected data is available open-source on the web. With proper analysis, the Dataset would help us to answer real-world questions. For instance, we can find the most popular language that the data scientists use. Our project is to analyze the survey data and gather meaningful insights from it.

The questions that we answered as part of the analysis were given in the Data analysis. This readme.md file explains our project.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are black, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

        
## Features

-   Runs in a commandline


## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

-   [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)


### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
    - .This is a Python library for data analysis and manipulation. It is what was used to read the CSV survey data and covert it into dataframes which could be easy to analyze.
2. [NUmpy](https://numpy.org/)
    - This is a tool for scientific coputing using Python. This helps us group our data into arrays, we also used it to access functions that were necessary for making decisions of attributes in our dataframes.
3. [Time](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - This module provides various time-related functions.
4. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
5. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
6. [Heroku:](https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/photoshop.html)
    - This is the platform that gave us the environment for easy deployment.


### Known Bugs

- Since it is a CLI application, it can only run within a terminal environment.

## Deployment
